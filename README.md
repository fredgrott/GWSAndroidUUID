GWSAndroidUUID
==============

To compute the Android UUID in a secure and reliable way.

Implementation
==============

I set up an GWSAndroidUuidFactory to first check and see if we already stored the Uuid and if so use
that as the Uuid. If the Uuid has never been created before an Uuid is created taking into account the
different device environments that Android OS can be found in and making sure that if a pure androidID
value is used that its hashed to obscure it.

Obscuring the androidID alone will not secure and that is why we use the secure settings
to grab the had value of the androidID. Its not a perfect solution. When everyone switches to android
OS 6.0 we than can employ a faster more crypto-enhanced solution.

The reason why we cannot use androidID alone is two-fold, one we have enough devices(over 1 billion)
that some popular app might hit androidID number collision as its a small bit number.
The other reason is that we have secure it in some way and hashing it and mixing it some other stuff in
combination with obfuscating the code via proguard helps raise the bar.

Usage
=====

I use jitpack to upload my libraries so you put this in your root buildscript:

```groovy
allprojects {
        repositories {
            jcenter()
            maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        }
   }
```
Than in the module buildscript:


```groovy
compile 'com.github.shareme:GWSAndroidUUID:{latest-release-number}@aar'
```


Now for using this library
In your application class

```java
onCreate{
         GWSAndroidUuidFactory myUUId =new DeviceUuidFactory(context);
     }
```

Target Android API Range
========================

Api 16 to api 23.
